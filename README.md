# To-Do List Management System

## Project Overview
The **To-Do List Management System** is a simple web-based application developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project demonstrates the practical application of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** in software engineering.

It allows users to:
- Add tasks
- View tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

---

## Full Meaning of SDLC
**SDLC** stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**.

It is a structured process used in software engineering to plan, design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain software systems in an organized and efficient manner.

## SDLC Phases Used in This Project

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system was analyzed to determine the required features:
- Add a task
- Display all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

---

### 2. System Design
The system was designed with the following structure:

**System Name:** To-Do List Management System  
**Main Entity:** Task  

#### Task Attributes
- `taskId` – Unique identifier for each task  
- `taskName` – Name of the task  
- `isCompleted` – Task completion status  

> All names and nomenclature used in the design are exactly the same as those used in the implementation.

---

### 3. Implementation
The system was implemented using:
- **HTML** for structure (`index.html`)
- **CSS** for styling (`style.css`)
- **JavaScript** for functionality (`script.js`)

---

### 4. Testing
The system was tested to ensure:
- Tasks can be added successfully
- Tasks can be marked as completed
- Tasks can be deleted without errors

---

### 5. Deployment
The project is deployed locally by opening the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

---

### 6. Maintenance
Future improvements may include:
- Saving tasks using localStorage
- Enhancing the user interface
- Adding task categories and deadlines
